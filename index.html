<!-- Lyrics -->
    <p><span class="first_verse">She'd take the world off my shoulders <br>
        If it was ever hard to move <br>
        She'd turn the rain to a rainbow<br>
        When I was living in the blue<br>
        Why then, if she is so perfect<br>
        Do I still wish that it was you?<br>
        Perfect don't mean that it's working<br>
        So what can I do? (Ooh)<br><br> </span>
        When you're out of sight<br>
        In my mind<br><br>
        <span class="second_verse">
        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
        And I try to fall for her touch<br>
        But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
        I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
        Hoping I'll find<br>
        A glimpse of us<br><br></span>
        <span class = "third_verse">
        Tell me he savors your glory<br>
        Does he laugh the way I did?<br>
        Is this a part of your story?<br>
        One that I had never lived<br>
        Maybe one day you'll feel lonely<br>
        And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<br>
        Maybe you'll start slipping slowly<br>
        And find me again<br><br></span>
        When you're out of sight<br>
        In my mind<br><br>
        <span class="fourth_verse">
        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
        And I try to fall for her touch<br>
        But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
        I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
        Hoping I'll find<br>
        A glimpse of us<br><br></span>
        <span class = "fifth_verse">
        Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br><br></span>
        <span class = "sixth_verse">
        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
        And I try to fall for her touch<br>
        But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
        I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
        Hoping I'll find<br>
        A glimpse of us</p></span>
